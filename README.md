# Shader Development Sandbox

After a few weeks of recreating arcade classics, I dabbled a little bit with particle simulation. In that project, I briefly used shaders just to draw athe particles to the screen to increase performance. With this repo I want to really explore what shaders are and get comfortable using them. 

I plan to follow a some tutorials found online and build a bunch of different things inside this repo. If I find something really interesting, I may break it out of this project and dedicate more time to it inside a seperate repo. I've said it before but Odin has really revitalized my joy of programming. I will update this README with the projects/shader experiments explored inside this repo.

*Stay hungry, stay foolish*
